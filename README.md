Confictura Industries on the World Wide Web! ðŸ˜ˆ

## What is this repository?

A QR code leading to [www.conficturaindustries.com](http://www.conficturaindustries.com) first appeared in Elliotâ€™s notebook, during [Mr. Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/)â€™s premiere. This repository is a copy of the website form 2016 (when Mr. Robot's second season was airing).

## Was anything modified?

Yes, the source code was "beautified" using [beautifier.io](https://beautifier.io/) and the *width* argument was changed at line 9, column 31 through 68. The filenames of the images were also modified.
